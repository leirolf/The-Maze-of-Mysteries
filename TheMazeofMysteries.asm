    storyline1: .asciiz "[ Once upon a time, there was a young man named Kato who loved to explore. While wandering deep in the forest, he stumbled upon a strange door hidden among the trees. Curiosity getting the better of him, he decided to open it. As soon as he did, a strong force pulled him through, and he found himself in a dark place. But beneath him was something soft and squishy, like jelly. To his surprise, everything around him lit up. There were these mushroom-like things that glowed, and even floating jelly creatures that shimmered with light. In the distance, Kato noticed a huge door. It looked majestic. Despite feeling a little scared, he knew he had to find out what was behind it. With each step, his heart beat faster, but he was determined to uncover the secrets of this mysterious place. ]"
    storyline2: .asciiz "[ As Kato approached the majestic door, he was taken aback to see a guard stationed there. But what truly astonished him was that the guard wasn't just any ordinary guard; it was a stone statue that could talk. ]"
    storyline3: .asciiz "[ The door swung open, revealing a shimmering, splendid sight. A grand staircase stretched before you, its entrance marked by a translucent blue barrier. An inscription upon the barrier read, 'Stair locked. Complete the riddle first.' ]"
    stoneguard1: .asciiz " 'Greetings, young man. I am delighted to see you here. I know you have a lot of questions in your mind. But if you want a simple answer, you are in the labyrinth, and this door will lead you to get out of it. However, before you can escape, there are ten levels of this gate. Each level has a riddle to solve. To move to the next level, you must answer the riddle correctly. You are not allowed to have mistake, or it will be game over, and you will be stuck in the labyrinth forever, becoming a human nutrient of this labyrinth.' "
    stoneguard2: .asciiz " 'Good luck, young man. I hope you will answer the riddle correctly. Remember, the truth has a way of finding the light, even when you think you're hidden in the dark.' "

    afterlv3: .asciiz " 'Well done! A thought can be a form of silent communication and can be triggered by fear. You may now proceed to the next level.' "
    afterlv4: .asciiz " 'Well done! Buttons often have small holes that resemble eyes, but they can't actually see. You may now proceed to the next level.' "

    afterlv6: .asciiz " 'Well done! Your breath is very light, and while you can hold it for a short time, you can't physically hold it indefinitely. You may now proceed to the next level.' "
    afterlv7: .asciiz " 'Well done! A compass has a needle that points north, but it doesn't literally see. It guides direction, which is truthful, but also has a 'north' and 'south' pole, which can be confusing if not understood correctly. You may now proceed to the next level.' "
    afterlv8: .asciiz " 'Well done!  Fire constantly consumes fuel, so it's metaphorically hungry and thirsty, but you can't nourish it with physical food or water. You may now proceed to the next level.' "
    afterlv9: .asciiz " 'Well done!  You need to crack an egg open before you can use its contents for cooking. You may now proceed to the next level.' "
    afterlv10: .asciiz " 'Well done!  Time is a constant flow, always progressing forward (coming but never arriving). It's always present in the moment (present but never here), and constantly creates new moments while leaving old ones behind (always old and always new). 'Congratulations! You've completed all the riddles. You can now get out of the labyrinth.' "
